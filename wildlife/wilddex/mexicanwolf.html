<h2>About the Mexican Wolf!</h2>

<div class="descript"><p>&quot;Commonly known as the &quot;lobo&quot;, this wolf once inhabited Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. The Mexican wolf is the most endangered of the subspecies, and is one of the rarest land mammals on earth. 
    <br>There are currently about 370 wolves in 63 captive facilities around the United States and Mexico. In March 1998, 35 Mexican wolves in six packs were released in Apache National Forest in Arizona. 
    <br>As of the annual count for 2021, there are a minimum of 196 free ranging wolves in the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area in Arizona and New Mexico. In 2011, 10 Mexican wolves were released in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. 
    <br>As of 2021, there are about 45 free ranging wolves there.&quot;<b> -California Wolf Center</b></p>
    
<p>&quot;Roughly five feet in length, Mexican gray wolves generally weigh between 50 and 80 pounds. Their coats are buff, gray, and rust colored, often with distinguishing facial patterns. 
    <br>They have large heads with thick muzzles, bushy tails, oversized paws, and long legs. 
    <br>Wolves are known for their keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and binocular vision. 
    <br>Mexican gray wolves are the smallest of all the gray wolf subspecies in North America.&quot;<b> -Center for Biological Diversity</b></p>
