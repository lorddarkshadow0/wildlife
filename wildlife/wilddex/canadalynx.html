<h2>About the Canadian Lynx!</h2>

<div class="descript"><p>&quot;The Canadian Lynx is a lanky, medium sized cat whose thick fur gives the impression of a much larger animal. 
    <br>This lynx has elongated legs with hind limbs distinctly longer then the forelimbs giving a characteristic leggy appearance. 
    <br>This in enhanced by the by the very large, snowshoe-like paws and a heavy covering of dense fur to facilitate moving on soft snow.&quot;<b> -Great Cats World Park</b></p>
    
<p>&quot;Known for being a single bonded and territorial animal, this beautiful cat is marketed to buyers in the United States along with bobcat ownership. 
    <br>An expensive, and often times illegal, private possession of the Canada Lynx, includes a dedicated lifespan of ~20 years in captivity. 
    <br>These cats are predictably dangerous as they mature and will attack in protection of what they perceive to be their “person” or territory. 
    <br>Though legal to own in some areas they are generally classified as inherently dangerous wild animals. Their razor sharp teeth and hooked claws can cause instant severe harm.&quot;
